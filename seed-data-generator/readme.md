This Node script can generate seed data for the tables in the database

It was written because we had a database of users, addresses, products, etc from public domain, but we needed to create orders with products in them for users.
This is a little complicated, so this script generates valid relational seed data records for this purpose and is configurable.

Probably it would have been better and easier to use *Synth*, but we weren't aware of it then =(
