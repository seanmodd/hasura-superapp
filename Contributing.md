# Contributing

This project has a very wide scope, with various portions being deeper than others. If you find an area you'd like to contribute to improve the readability, best-practices, or idiomatic patterns of either Postgres or React, create a pull request simply explaining in story format what you are wanting to change and why.

We love community engagement!
